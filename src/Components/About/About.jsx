          <h2>Construction Estimating Company</h2>

          <p>
            Our team of experienced Project Managers and Estimators know the
            challenges of running a business and still having to bid jobs.
            Sometimes it feels like it’s almost impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve developed a turnkey estimating solution utilizing Digital
            Takeoff and Estimating Software so we can quickly estimate the costs
            for your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re one of the few construction estimating companies that are a
            licensed General Contractor and perform our own estimating for our
            projects.

          <h2>Benefits of Outsourcing Estimating</h2>

          <p>
            Running a construction business is one of the most difficult and
            challenging types of businesses to run. We’ve been in the trenches,
            and we are a licensed General Contractor. So we know the struggles.

          <h2>Why Outsource Estimating</h2>

          <p>
            Are you missing out on projects because you don’t have time to
            perform your construction takeoffs and finalize your estimates?
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of our clients are working late trying to bid projects and
            create accurate estimates to win jobs. It’s almost impossible to
            focus on projects during the day when there are distractions on the
            job site!
          </p>
          <p>
            We specialize in working with Contractors and Developers. Our team
            of seasoned estimators will digitally takeoff the quantities for
            your project and create your entire bid for you!
          </p>
          <p>You’ll only need 15-20 minutes to review.</p>

          <h2>Highly Accurate Construction Cost Database</h2>

          <p>
            We use a highly accurate construction cost database that gives us
            up-to-date labor and material pricing. It’s based on the zip code,
            so your project will be as accurate and competitive as possible.
